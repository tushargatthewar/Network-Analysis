# Blockchain
# Blockchain Project Readme

This repository contains a blockchain project implemented in Python. The project aims to create a simple blockchain system with the ability to add and verify blocks.

## Features

- Block creation: New blocks can be added to the blockchain. Each block contains a timestamp, data, a hash of the previous block, and a hash of its own contents.
- Block verification: The integrity of the blockchain can be verified by checking the hash of each block and ensuring it matches the hash of the previous block.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-project.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd blockchain-project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the project:

   ```bash
   python blockchain.py
   ```

## Usage

The blockchain project provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the blockchain. Here are the available commands:

- `add`: Add a new block to the blockchain.
  - Example: `add "New block data"`
- `list`: Display all blocks in the blockchain.
- `verify`: Verify the integrity of the blockchain.

## Examples

To add a new block to the blockchain:

```bash
python blockchain.py add "Hello, world!"
```

To list all blocks in the blockchain:

```bash
python blockchain.py list
```

To verify the integrity of the blockchain:

```bash
python blockchain.py verify
```
